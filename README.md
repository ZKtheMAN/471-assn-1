# FTP Server File using Socket Programming
# Language: Python 3
# Testing environment:  Unbuntu Linux

Getting Starterd:
  All that is needed to run this project is to have a version of python 3.
  
Running the Project:
  To run the project, first the user must open a terminal
  Then the user must run the server.py by navigating to the proper location of the file.
  Once there, the easiest way to do this would be to run the file via the command. 
  
    $ python server.py
    
  Once the server is up and running, a brief message will appear to the user to confirm the server is running.
  After that, open a seperate terminal while leaving the first running the server.
  After the second terminal is open, navigate to the location of the client.py file and run it.
  Once there, the easiest way to do this would be to run the file via the command. 
  
    $ python client.py
  
  After the client is running, a list of commands should appear. The first command you will need to use is
  
  CONN
  
  This will connect the client and the server.
  Upon a successful connection, a message will prompt the confirmation of a successful connection
  After that, all the other commands can be entered through the client side terminal.
  The commands include:. 
  
    $ CONN           : Connect to server"
      UPLD file_path : Upload a file"
      LIST           : List all the files"
      DWLD file_path : Download a file from the server"
      DELF file_path : Delete a file"
      QUIT           : Exit the program")
